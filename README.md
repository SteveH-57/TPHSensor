"# TPHSensor" 
Temperature Pressure Humidity Sensor Project
Project Status: INACTIVE â€“ The TPH sensors are extremely inaccurate, different sensors on the same circuit show 20 degree differences.  Started playing with Angular Material but did not complete.
Programmed 10 ESP8266 (wireless ethernet boards) to read temperature, pressure and humidity sensors (3 different models) and send the information to a TABLE STORAGE via a Microsoft Azure Cloud Web App Service.  The Web Service hosts a page to display the data.
Data only exists from 4/22/2018 thru 6/22/2018
Goal: Monitor TPH in multiple rooms and locations.
Key Features:  Generic Class for handling Azure Table storage. 
To Do: Security, Address UTC time, sensor accuracy.
Technologies: Arduino, C#, Azure, Angular
